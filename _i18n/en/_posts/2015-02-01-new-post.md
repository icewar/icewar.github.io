### Dalvik

Dalvik is a VM.

* JIT compiler: compile at runtime
* only compile method that will be run (only hot code is compiled)
* Concurrent GC

### ART

* GC performance improved, less pause time
* Ahead-of-time compilation
	* compilation time spent at installation
	* build as part of firmware image


```c
#include <stdio.h>

int
```
