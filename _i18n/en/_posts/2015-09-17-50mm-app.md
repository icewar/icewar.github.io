In photography, __prime lens__ is a symbol of professional and high quality picture. This app make your iPhone into some of the most popular prime lenses in the world. With different prime lenses, you can get the best result for different situations:

* __35mm lens__: great for street photography
* __50mm lens__: for full body portrait
* __85mm lens__: great for half body portrait
* __135mm lens__: The King of Portrait

Take the photos below as an example:

In these photos, the girl occupies same space. The differences are in 2 aspect:

* Background range: the longer the focus length, the smaller the background range
* Blurry: the longer the focus length, the more blurry the background and the foreground

That's the `SECRET` you create `ATPHOSPHERE` in your photo !!!

With this app, you become a photographer with a bag of prime lenses. You can easily change your lenses with just one click. The rest, is to shoot great pictures.

Last but not the least, as a great mobile app, we also provides features of:

* Sharing image directly to many apps, e.g. Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram etc,.
